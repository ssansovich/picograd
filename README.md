# picograd
Andrej Karpathy's ([karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy)) [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) implemented in pure C for learning purposes. Implements a multi-layer perceptron neural net, complete with backpropagation and gradient descent.

I did this for learning purposes. It definitely leaks memory and has a couple of bugs.
